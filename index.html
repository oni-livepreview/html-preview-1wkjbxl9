Certainly! Below is a simple HTML code that creates a webpage with a "Hello, World!" heading:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html lang="en">`: The root element of the HTML document, with the language attribute set to English.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as character set and viewport settings.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the document.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures the webpage is responsive and scales properly on different devices.
- `<title>Hello World Page</title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.
- `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`: Creates a heading with the text "Hello, World!".

You can copy and paste this code into a new file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in a web browser to see the result.
